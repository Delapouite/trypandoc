{"text":"Just as the components of a vector change when we change the [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the vector space, the components of a tensor also change under such a transformation.  Each type of tensor comes equipped with a ''transformation law'' that details how the components of the tensor respond to a [[change of basis]].  The components of a vector can respond in two distinct ways to a [[change of basis]] (see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]]), where the new [[basis vectors]] <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_i</math> are expressed in terms of the old basis vectors <math>\\mathbf{e}_j</math> as,\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\mathbf{e}_j R^j_i = \\mathbf{e}_j R^j_i .</math>\n\nHere ''R''<sup>'' j''</sup><sub>''i''</sub> are the entries of the change of basis matrix, and in the rightmost expression the [[summation]] sign was suppressed: this is the [[Einstein summation convention]], which will be used throughout this article.<ref group=\"Note\">The Einstein summation convention, in brief, requires the sum to be taken over all values of the index whenever the same symbol appears as a subscript and superscript in the same term.  For example, under this convention <math>B_i C^i = B_1 C^1 + B_2 C^2 + \\cdots B_n C^n</math></ref>  The components ''v''<sup>''i''</sup> of a column vector '''v''' transform with the [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of the matrix ''R'',\n:<math>\\hat{v}^i = \\left(R^{-1}\\right)^i_j v^j,</math>\n\nwhere the hat denotes the components in the new basis.  This is called a ''contravariant'' transformation law, because the vector components transform by the ''inverse'' of the change of basis.  In contrast, the components, ''w''<sub>''i''</sub>, of a covector (or row vector), '''w''', transform with the matrix ''R'' itself,\n:<math>\\hat{w}_i = w_j R^j_i .</math>","from":"mediawiki","to":"docx","standalone":true}
