Many states have established [ventless trap\n        survey](http://www.asmfc.org/fisheries-science/surveys)s to quantify\n        the abundance of juvenile lobsters. By removing escape vents from\n        the lobster traps and randomly placing those traps within certain\n        depth categories and geographic areas, researchers can assess the\n        abundance of juvenile lobsters and the potential for young lobsters\n        to reach a size or life stage that can be caught by the fishing gear\n        (recruitment) in the future. These surveys complement longstanding\n        fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys conducted by NOAA Fisheries\n        and the states. Because trawl gear cannot effectively sample rocky\n        or shallow coastal bottom types, the ventless trap surveys attempt\n        to fill this data gap by using fixed lobster gear without escape\n        vents.\n  fishing_rate: |\n    At recommended levels.\n  sugars_total: |\n    0 g\n  taste: |\n    Mild and sweet.\n  health_benefits: |\n    Lobster is low in saturated fat and is a very good source of protein and\n    selenium.
